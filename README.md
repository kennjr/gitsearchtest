## Known Bugs

We don't have any known bugs.

## Technologies Used

This project uses HTML and CSS for most of the front-end plus TypeScript for the business logic.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
If you run into any issues with the code you can contribute to the project, reporting the issue and probably suggesting a fix.

## Future

We are planning to add more search features so that users can search for Issues, commits, code, discussions, packages, topics and wikis.
